This directory stores test software for testing CHIRIMEN.

However, many test parts are examples itselfs. In addition, the circuit for testing, as described at https://github.com/chirimen-oh/chirimen/issues/24 , is required.

Meanwhile, the implementations added under this directory are mainly modified examples to avoid collision of I2C addres.

The list of addresses of I2C devices are as follows.
